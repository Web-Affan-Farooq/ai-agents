## Python test 1 : Data types :
### **Datatyes in python :**
#### **Numeric**
- `int` (represents number)
- `float` (represents float number)
- `complex` (represenst complex number use .real() and .img() to extract real and imaginary part)

#### **Sequence**
- `str` (represents sequence of characters)
- `list` (mutable collection)
- `tuple` (immutable collection)
- `range` (represents sequence of numbers)

#### **Set types**
- `set` 
- `frozenset` (use fronzenset() function)

#### **Mapping types**
- `dict` (store data as key value pairs)

#### **Binary types**
- `byte` (immutable sequence of bytes | declared as `b'hello'` )
- `Bytearray` (collection of bytes)

#### **other types**
- `None` (no value)
- `True and False`

#### **Extras**
- `memoryview()`  returns where the data is stored  
- `id()`  returns a unique identifier that can be used to identify objects in memory.
- `isInstance(object , classinfo)` returns true if classinfo belongs to the specified object

answers :
- In Python, why is 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3? Explain with IEEE-754 (because python stores the value nearest to the floating point rather than acual floating point specified , means if 0.1 is specified , it's not be stored 0.1 accurately)
- What happens if you evaluate float('inf') - float('inf')?   (result is nan)  (question passed)
- Why is True == 1 but True is 1 is False? (because by attaching the membership operator , we check if the both values belongs to sam object)
- What‚Äôs the output of:
```python
a = 256
b = 256
print(a is b) ## Answer True
c = 257
d = 257
print(c is d) ## Answer True
```
- Explain why -5 // 2 gives -3 and not -2. (because floor division returns roundedoff value) (question passed)
`/` divide operator (divide and return the actual value wheather it's float or int)
`//` floor division operator (returns rounded off value after divide)
`divmod()` (first divide and then returns the absolute value)  (question passed)
- Why does 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3 give a non-zero result? (already answeres above)
- Show a case where Decimal and Fraction behave differently.( not approached)
